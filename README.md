# ts-amz-spapi

TypeScript interfaces for Amazon SP-API, derived from running openapi-typescript on selling-partner-api-models

This is the output of

```javascript
npx openapi-typescript@5.0.0 "models/**/*.json" --output schemas/
```

I'm not right at this moment sure if this is useful, but it's something i ran across that looks like it could be.
